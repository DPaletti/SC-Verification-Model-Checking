# Colored Petri Networks for Smart Contract Verification
All the models have been implemented and simulated with [CPN Tools](https://cpntools.org/)
Two contracts have been modelled:
- Pyramid: an example of a fraudolent pyramidal scheme
- [WETH9](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2): a contract which allows to convert ETH in wETH tokens

See [the literature review](CPN-Tools/Formal_Verification_of_Smart_Contracts.pdf) for an in-depth overview on Colored Petri Networks and other approaches to Smart Contract Verification.
